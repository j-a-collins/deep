Welcome to my obligatory online presence or whatever.

This space will blog my interests and concerns related to **Deep Learning** and my fascination and research in **Quantum Mechanics**. If you leave here with one thing to think about, let it be that artificial intelligence presents a significant and potentially existential challenge to humanity â€“ but not in the ways that the _AI Safety_ community insist on. We can, however, be ready for our new future by asking greater challenges of ourselves and the world _now_ by being involved in the world we choose to create.
